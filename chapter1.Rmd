### My background and expectations


**How I found out about this course**

I already came across this course last year (unfortunately didn't have the time to participate) and was already intrigued about the contents and impressed by the fabulous feedback.

**My background ** 

As a graduate student in physics I got quite fond of using python for my data analysis work, e.g. extracting useful things out of huge data sets, manipulating data frames, visualize data in an understandable way.

**My expectations ** 

I am now quite excited to see and compare what is possible with R - I am looking forward to participate in this interesting course! So far, the "warming up" week went fine and the introductions were easy to follow. The syntax shown too far didn't look too complicated and partially familiar to *python* or *python* libraries such as *pandas* and *matplotlib*. As I am quite used to python (and it is more and more used in natural sciences), I don't expect to switch to *R* after the course, but would love to learn more about it and achieve an understanding of what the pros and cons are. So that in some particular case I might be able to say "Ok, this is something for what *R* might be in fact better." And furthermore, it's always fun to learn new skills.:)

# I don't know if I should extend this example here, but just to try it out:
print("Hello R")

**Looking forward to next week!**
